## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I ended up changing my layout and not including the drop down drawers to the folders. More or less had to do with the time I had to complete the project. I didnt slack off, I just chose to focus on testing and as much functionality I could include.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/EvanSays/jetfuel/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Im really happy that I was able to write tests and use my test database. Super proud about all of that.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/EvanSays/jetfuel/blob/master/public/styles.css)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

When I switch my layout, with the time I had left, I was not able to clean out all the unused css. I felt rushed and didnt look back too often, other than to make the neccessary changes needed to complete the project.
